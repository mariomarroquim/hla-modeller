# HLA Modeller

This script generates 3D models of HLA molecules using ESMFold (https://esmatlas.com) with data from the latest IPD-IMGT/HLA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla). For research use only. Not for diagnostic purposes.

## Instructions

Current HLA models are in the `output` folder. Of the 21,132 HLA sequences available at the latest (late 2023) IPD-IMGT/HLA release, 11,040 had the expected length (regarding a reference mature HLA protein of the same locus) and were used to generate the models. To generate models for a newer IPD-IMGT/HLA release, run `ruby run.rb`.
