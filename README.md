# HLA Modeller

This script generates 3D models of the most [common](https://www.ihiw18.org/component-immunogenetics/download-common-and-well-documented-alleles-3-0) HLA alleles using [Meta's ESMFold](https://esmatlas.com) with data from the latest [IPD-IMGT/HLA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla) release. For research use only. Not for diagnostic purposes.

## Instructions

Current models are in the [output](https://github.com/mariomarroquim/hla-modeller/tree/main/output) folder. To generate models for a newer IPD-IMGT/HLA release, run `ruby run.rb`. To view a model, download a PDB file from the output folder and use a visualizer, like [Molstar](https://molstar.org/viewer).
