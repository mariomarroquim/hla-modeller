# HLA Modeller

This script generates 3D models of the most common (https://www.ihiw18.org/component-immunogenetics/download-common-and-well-documented-alleles-3-0) HLA molecules using Meta's ESMFold (https://esmatlas.com) with data from the latest IPD-IMGT/HLA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla) release. For research use only. Not for diagnostic purposes.

## Instructions

Current HLA models are in the `output` folder. To generate models for a newer IPD-IMGT/HLA release, run `ruby run.rb`. To view these models, use Molstar (https://molstar.org/viewer).
